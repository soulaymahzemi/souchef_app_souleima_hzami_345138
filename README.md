## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

This project strictly follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern.

### Architecture Breakdown
- **Model**: Data classes defining the structure of objects (e.g., `Recipe`, `Chef`).
- **View**: UI components responsible for rendering the interface and capturing user input.
- **ViewModel**: Business logic layer that processes data, handles state changes, and communicates with the View via `Provider`.

### Technology Stack
| Category | Technology | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Framework** | Flutter | Cross-platform UI toolkit |
| **Language** | Dart | Programming language |
| **State Management** | Provider | Efficient state injection and notification |
| **Backend** | Firebase | Auth, Database, and Analytics |
| **Networking** | HTTP | API communication |
| **UI/UX** | ScreenUtil | Responsive design adaptation |
